## The Towlr Manifesto

The rest of this document is copy of the [Towlr Manifesto][3].

	- THE ESSENTIALS -

	A Towlr puzzle should prominently feature the iconic + symbol somewhere.  It usually
	has no purpose.

	A Towlr puzzle must be a complete experience.  Graphics and Sound.

	A Towlr puzzle should keep an error count, and upon completion share with the player
	how many tries it took to complete.  This is commonly associated with cake.  Contrary
	to Portal, cake does not lie in Towlr.  Cake is truth.  Cake is success.

	A good Towlr puzzle should have an obvious solution (obvious once you realize it), 
	and shouldn't require twitch reflexes to complete.

	THE TEN CLASSIC COMMANDMENTS

	1. Towlr shall without fail display a + sign in the center of the screen at all
	   times.  This + shall have no purpose in gameplay.
	2. Towlr will not give the player any indication of what goals the player is
	   trying to achieve.
	3. Towlr will display clearly and offensively when the player has failed,
	   resetting to a default state.  The preferred display is a blinding flash with
	   awful noise.
	4. Towlr shall be in a web browser or a window, not fullscreen.
	5. Towlr will display the player's number of attempts in clear numerical form,
	   preferably in an upper corner of the screen.
	6. Other than this number, Towlr will display only simple geometric shapes,
	   preferably in horrid colors.
	7, Towlr will only output sounds that are grating and awful, and computerized.
	   No recognizable sounds or speech.
	8. Towlr is a single display, no title screen and no multiple screens or scrolling.
	9. Towlr shall award cake to the player upon victory, clearly displaying the final
	   number of attempts in the process.  The cake and final total may be displayed
	   visually or with text, and are exempt from commandments #1 and #5-8.
	10. There are no tricks in Towlr.  Towlr shall provide sufficient information to
	   be completed in the context of play.  A player who completes Towlr will smack
	   their forehead and say "Oh, of course that's what you do!" at some point during
	   gameplay, as opposed to "There's no possible reason why that worked".


	THE BILL OF DESIGNER'S RIGHTS

	1. Towlr may accept input in mouse or keyboard form (or both).  Only input devices
	   that are commonly available are permitted.
	2. You may name your Towlr in any reasonable fashion provided the word Towlr appears
	   in the name, and the name is confusing and off-putting.
	3. Towlr may incorporate dexterity challenges in addition to puzzle-solving.
